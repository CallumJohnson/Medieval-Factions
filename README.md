# Medieval Factions

## Description
Medieval Factions is a system of mechanics that allows for the simulation of sovereign nations in Minecraft. Players can create nations, claim territory, engage in warfare or politics, write laws or hold dueling tournaments, and generally are able to attempt to recreate society somewhat.

### Looking to create an add-on plugin?
I recommend using [FactionsBridge](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsbridge.89716/) by [Retrix_Solutions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/retrix_solutions.491191/). It would make your add-on plugin usable across a number of factions implementations.

Alternatively, you can use the External API, the documentation for which can be found [here](https://github.com/dmccoystephenson/Medieval-Factions/wiki/External-API-Documentation).
