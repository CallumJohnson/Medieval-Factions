# Medieval Factions

## Description
This is a minecraft plugin for players to use to organize politically. It allows them to create/manage factions, declare/end wars, and claim/unclaim land. It also supports promoting/demoting players to and from officer positions as well as a power level system to decide land limits. Finally, it supports faction homes, alliances and locks.

### Looking to create an add-on plugin?
I recommend using [FactionsBridge](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsbridge.89716/) by [Retrix_Solutions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/retrix_solutions.491191/). It would make your add-on plugin usable across a number of factions implementations.
